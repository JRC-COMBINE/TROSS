**Tropical Sensitivity Scores (TROSS)**

TROSS is a software implemented in R for studying the effects of perturbations in biochemical reaction networks describing
the intracellular processes. The software uses tropical geometry methods to determine metastable states of non-linear ordinary differential
equations parametrized by orders of magnitude. The changes in such states due to perturbations in the model parameters are reported as tropical sensitivity scores.

**Why should I use TROSS?**

TROSS determines the parameter sensitivity scores for a given biochemical reaction network based on the changes in the tropical solutions. 
The program determines the tropical sensitivity score for a given parameter by perturbing it with a predefined number of orders of magnitude up and down. 
The extension of the software to handle simultaneous perturbations of multiple parameters will be released soon.

**How do I use TROSS?**

| Arguments        |           |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| `model_name`    | Name of the model in `db/` folder.| 
| `path_ptcut`    | Path to ptcut.py file (see installation instructions).   |  
| `p_list`        | Vector of parameters to perform parameter perturbations. Each paremeter in this list will be perturbed individually for computing the tropical sensitivity score.|   
|`path_p`        |  Installation directory. Default is `paste(getwd(), "/", sep="")`|
|`num_var`        |  Number of variables|
|`num_pars`       |  Number of parameters|
|`ini_vals`       |  Initial values of the variables. The length should be same as `num_var`|
|`ep`             |  Value of epsilon. It should be same as the epsilon used to compute tropical solutions|
|`lb_v`           |  Lower bound on variable concentrations. This is used to put bounds during uniform sampling|
|`ub_v`           |  Upper bound on variable concentrations. This is used to put bounds during uniform sampling|
|`num_points`     |  Total number of sample points. Non-zero dimensional polytopes have infinite sample points|            
|`BB`             |  Apply the `lb_v` and `ub_v` bounds while performing uniform sampling|
|`ncores`         |  Number of cores to parallelise the program|
|`l_p`            |  p-value in l_p norm for distance computation |
|`norder`         |  The grid points are incremented and the sequence of equations for computing tropical solutions.|
|`order`          |  The ordering affects the computation time considerably. However, the tropical solutions are unaffected to the ordering of the equations.|

|Value        |           |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|`tg_l`        |  The tropical sensitivity score for each parameter in p_list.|
|`tg_l_all`        |  The minimum Euclidean distance of tropical minimal branches corresponding to parameter <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\text{ }k_j\text{ }" /> perturbed by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\text{ }\gamma_i\text{ }" /> from each of the nominal (unperturbed) tropical minimal branches.|

**Examples**
```source("run.R")
result = computeTROSS(
              model_name = "tgf_tif_10_h3_00557", 
              path_ptcut = "/home/jk075370/tropinet/tropchapter/ptcut-v2-3-0/ptcut.py",
              p_list =  c('k1'),
              path_p = paste(getwd(), "/", sep=""),
              num_var = 21,
              num_pars = 41,
              ini_vals = rep(0,21),
              ep = 11,
              lb_v = 10^-20,
              ub_v = 10^10,
              num_points = 1E4,             
	            BB = TRUE,
              ncores = 3,
              l_p = 2,
              norder = 3,
              order = ''
              )
